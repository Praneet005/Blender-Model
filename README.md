# Stormy Ocean Model

A stormy ocean model in Blender is a 3D simulation designed to realistically depict the tumultuous, chaotic nature of the ocean during a storm. This model typically includes high, choppy waves, dynamic surface motion, and atmospheric effects like dark skies and turbulent winds. The buoy model was downloaded seperately and added to the model.
